# A Practice & Refrence Sample of Angular
The purpose of this project is just for practice and prototyping. 
During my Angular2 learning processs, I found that Angular2 is very powerful but has too many things to memorize.
So I try to build this demo app with the components I will frequently use in my future projects and therefore I can copy any component whenever I need it. Of course, I will be more than happy if this project can help you too.

## Usage
Github this repo to your local machine and cd to the directory. 
Run `npm install`.
Then, Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Do whatever you want in files of src/app with any IDE you like. I personally recommend use Visual studio code and Angular-related extention.
